# GNU-Linux-Config-Files

Dotfiles configuring my KDE + i3 development environment.


##Usage:
Pull using YADM
Install ansible
Execute ansible scripts in .dotfiles/.ansible as wanted

##Current Issues:
* Simple Menu often appears in the centre of the screen
    * Potential Causes: Wrong i3 configuration / NVidia drivers / 19.04 instead
      of 18.04
